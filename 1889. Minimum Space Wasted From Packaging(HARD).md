 # [1889. Minimum Space Wasted From Packaging](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-space-wasted-from-packaging/)

You have n packages that you are trying to place in boxes, one package in each box. There are m suppliers that each produce boxes of different sizes (with infinite supply). A package can be placed in a box if the size of the package is less than or equal to the size of the box.
The package sizes are given as an integer array packages, where packages[i] is the size of the ith package. The suppliers are given as a 2D integer array boxes, where boxes[j] is an array of box sizes that the jth supplier produces.
You want to choose a single supplier and use boxes from them such that the total wasted space is minimized. For each package in a box, we define the space wasted to be size of the box - size of the package. The total wasted space is the sum of the space wasted in all the boxes.
For example, if you have to fit packages with sizes [2,3,5] and the supplier offers boxes of sizes [4,8], you can fit the packages of size-2 and size-3 into two boxes of size-4 and the package with size-5 into a box of size-8. This would result in a waste of (4-2) + (4-3) + (8-5) = 6.
Return the minimum total wasted space by choosing the box supplier optimally, or -1 if it is impossible to fit all the packages inside boxes. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Example 1:

>Input: packages = [2,3,5], boxes = [[4,8],[2,8]]
Output: 6
Explanation: It is optimal to choose the first supplier, using two size-4 boxes and one size-8 box.
The total waste is (4-2) + (4-3) + (8-5) = 6.

Idea

We always use the box with minimum size if possible to wrap a package, because larger box consumes more wasted space.
Sort packages by increasing order of its size.
For each boxSizes in boxes:
Sort boxSizes by increasing order of its size
totalBoxSize = 0
For each boxSize in boxSizes:
We binary search to find the largest index of the package which is less or equal to boxSize
So we can count number of remain packages that this box can be packed.
Update totalBoxSize
If we can pack all n packages, pick the minTotalBoxSize among suppliers.
The minTotalWasted = minTotalBoxSize - totalPackageSize

```C++
 class Solution {
public:
    int minWastedSpace(vector<int>& packages, vector<vector<int>>& boxes) {
        sort(packages.begin(), packages.end());
        int n = packages.size();
        long minTotalBoxSize = LONG_MAX;
        for (auto& boxSizes : boxes) {
            sort(boxSizes.begin(), boxSizes.end());
            long totalBoxSize = 0; // Total box size to pack all n packages
            int nextIdx = 0;
            for (int boxSize : boxSizes) {
                int idx = upper_bound(packages.begin(), packages.end(), boxSize) - packages.begin() - 1;
                long packedCount = (idx - nextIdx + 1); // number of remain packages that this box can be packed.
                totalBoxSize += packedCount * boxSize;
                nextIdx = idx + 1;
            }
            if (nextIdx == n) // check if we can packed all n packages
                minTotalBoxSize = min(minTotalBoxSize, totalBoxSize);
        }
        if (minTotalBoxSize == LONG_MAX) return -1; // can't packed all n packages
        long sumPackageSize = accumulate(packages.begin(), packages.end(), 0L);
        return (minTotalBoxSize - sumPackageSize) % 1000000007; // minTotalWasted = minTotalBoxSize - totalPackageSize
    }
};
