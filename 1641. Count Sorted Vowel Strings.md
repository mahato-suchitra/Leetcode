 # [1641. Count Sorted Vowel Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-sorted-vowel-strings/)

Given an integer n, return the number of strings of length n that consist only of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and are lexicographically sorted.
A string s is lexicographically sorted if for all valid i, s[i] is the same as or comes before s[i+1] in the alphabet.
Example 1:

Input: n = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: The 5 sorted strings that consist of vowels only are ["a","e","i","o","u"].

When n = 2, the only valid string starting with u is uu, valid strings starting with o are [oo, ou], and so on. The numbers (we use a vector cnt to store them) of valid strings starting with a, e, i, o, u are respectively [5,4,3,2,1].

When n = 3, the only valid string starting with u is uuu, valid strings starting with o are [ooo, oou, ouu], and so on. The numbers of valid strings starting with a, e, i, o, u are respectively [15,10,6,3,1].

A typical DP problem, and you can find the pattern here: during each iteration over 1 ~ n, the values of cnt can be calculated with its 'previous values'.
```C++
class Solution {
public:
  int countVowelStrings(int n) {
    vector<int64_t> cnt(5, 1);
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
      for (int j = 3; j >= 0; j--) cnt[j] += cnt[j + 1];
    return std::accumulate(cnt.begin(), cnt.end(), 0);
  }
};
```
