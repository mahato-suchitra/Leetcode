 # [1383. Maximum Performance of a Team](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-performance-of-a-team/)

You are given two integers n and k and two integer arrays speed and efficiency both of length n. There are n engineers numbered from 1 to n. speed[i] and efficiency[i] represent the speed and efficiency of the ith engineer respectively.
Choose at most k different engineers out of the n engineers to form a team with the maximum performance.
The performance of a team is the sum of their engineers' speeds multiplied by the minimum efficiency among their engineers.
Return the maximum performance of this team. Since the answer can be a huge number, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Example 1:
Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 2
Output: 60
Explanation: 
We have the maximum performance of the team by selecting engineer 2 (with speed=10 and efficiency=4) and engineer 5 (with speed=5 and efficiency=7). That is, performance = (10 + 5) * min(4, 7) = 60.

Problem can be understood as
For each efficency in efficiencyList:
Assume current efficiency is the minimum efficiency between at most k picked engineers.
We need to pick at most k highest speed engineers whose efficiency is greater or equal to efficiency.

Algorithm
First, we need to zip(efficiency, speed) of n engineers.
We need to sort n engineers by the decreasing order of their efficiency.
When we iterate over engineers by decreasing order of efficiency, we need to use minHeap structure to keep k largest speed engineers so far (top of minHeap is min speed, we can remove the lowest speed engineer when size of minHeap greater than k in O(1)).
The idea to keep k largest emenents is the same with 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxPerformance(int n, vector<int> &speed, vector<int> &efficiency, int k) {
        vector<pair<int, int>> engineers;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            engineers.emplace_back(efficiency[i], speed[i]);
        
        sort(rbegin(engineers), rend(engineers)); // Sort by decreasing order of efficiency
        long speedSum = 0, ans = 0;
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> minHeap;
        for (auto&[e, s] : engineers) {
            speedSum += s;
            minHeap.emplace(s);
            if (minHeap.size() > k) { // Over k engineers -> remove the lowest speed engineer
                speedSum -= minHeap.top();
                minHeap.pop();
            }
            ans = max(ans, speedSum * e);
        }
        return ans % (int) (1e9 + 7);
    }
};
