 # [1276. Number of Burgers with No Waste of Ingredients](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-burgers-with-no-waste-of-ingredients/)

Given two integers tomatoSlices and cheeseSlices. The ingredients of different burgers are as follows:

Jumbo Burger: 4 tomato slices and 1 cheese slice.
Small Burger: 2 Tomato slices and 1 cheese slice.
Return [total_jumbo, total_small] so that the number of remaining tomatoSlices equal to 0 and the number of remaining cheeseSlices equal to 0. If it is not possible to make the remaining tomatoSlices and cheeseSlices equal to 0 return [].

Example 1:

>Input: tomatoSlices = 16, cheeseSlices = 7
Output: [1,6]
Explantion: To make one jumbo burger and 6 small burgers we need 4*1 + 2*6 = 16 tomato and 1 + 6 = 7 cheese. There will be no remaining ingredients.

Imagine, x number of jumbo burgers and y number of small burgers are made from the given tomatoSlices and cheeseSlices.

So, the equation would be,
4x + 2y = tomatoSlices which means, total number of tomatoSlices required for making x jumbo burgers and y small burgers should be EXACTLY tomatoSlices (if possible)

Second equation would be,
x + y = cheeseSlices which means, total number of cheeseSlices required for making x jumbo burgers and y small burgers should be EXACTLY cheeseSlices (if possible)

The way we solve this equation is,
multiply 4 on both sides of equation 2.
So, 4x + 4y = 4*cheeseSlices  Equation 3
```C++
 class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> numOfBurgers(int t, int c) {
        if(t%2==0 && t>=2*c && 4*c>=t)
            return {t/2-c,2*c-t/2};
        return {};
    }
};
