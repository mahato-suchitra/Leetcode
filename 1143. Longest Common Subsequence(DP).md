 # [1143. Longest Common Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/)

Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

Example 1:

Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int longestCommonSubsequence(string text1, string text2) {
        int n=text1.size();
        int m=text2.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m+1,vector<int> (n+1,0));
        for(int i=1;i<=m;i++){
            for(int j=1;j<=n;j++){
                if(text2[i-1]==text1[j-1])
                    dp[i][j]=dp[i-1][j-1]+1;
                else
                    dp[i][j]=max(dp[i-1][j],dp[i][j-1]);
            }
        }
            return dp[m][n];
    }
};
```
