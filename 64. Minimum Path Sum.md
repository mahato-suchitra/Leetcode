 # [64. Minimum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/)

Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.
Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Example 1:
Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimizes the sum.

This is a typical DP problem. Suppose the minimum path sum of arriving at point (i, j) is S[i][j], then the state equation is S[i][j] = min(S[i - 1][j], S[i][j - 1]) + grid[i][j].

Well, some boundary conditions need to be handled. The boundary conditions happen on the topmost row (S[i - 1][j] does not exist) and the leftmost column (S[i][j - 1] does not exist). Suppose grid is like [1, 1, 1, 1], then the minimum sum to arrive at each point is simply an accumulation of previous points and the result is [1, 2, 3, 4].

Now we can write down the following (unoptimized) code.

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int minPathSum(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size(); 
        vector<vector<int> > sum(m, vector<int>(n, grid[0][0]));
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++)
            sum[i][0] = sum[i - 1][0] + grid[i][0];
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++)
            sum[0][j] = sum[0][j - 1] + grid[0][j];
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++)
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++)
                sum[i][j]  = min(sum[i - 1][j], sum[i][j - 1]) + grid[i][j];
        return sum[m - 1][n - 1];
    }
};
```
