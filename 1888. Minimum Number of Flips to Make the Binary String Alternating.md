 # [1888. Minimum Number of Flips to Make the Binary String Alternating](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-flips-to-make-the-binary-string-alternating/)

You are given a binary string s. You are allowed to perform two types of operations on the string in any sequence:

Type-1: Remove the character at the start of the string s and append it to the end of the string.
Type-2: Pick any character in s and flip its value, i.e., if its value is '0' it becomes '1' and vice-versa.
Return the minimum number of type-2 operations you need to perform such that s becomes alternating.

The string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal.

For example, the strings "010" and "1010" are alternating, while the string "0100" is not.

Example 1:

>Input: s = "111000"
Output: 2
Explanation: Use the first operation two times to make s = "100011".
Then, use the second operation on the third and sixth elements to make s = "101010".

Idea
For the 1st operation, we can simply do s += s to append the whole string to the end.
then we make two different string with the same length by 01 and 10 alternative. for example: s = 11100
s = 1110011100
s1= 1010101010
s2= 0101010101
finally, use sliding window（size n）to compare s to both s1 and s2.

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int minFlips(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        s += s;
        string s1, s2;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            s1 += i % 2 ? '0' : '1';
            s2 += i % 2 ? '1' : '0';
        }
        int ans1 = 0, ans2 = 0, ans = INT_MAX;
        for(int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            if(s1[i] != s[i]) ++ans1;
            if(s2[i] != s[i]) ++ans2;
            if(i >= n) { //the most left element is outside of sliding window, we need to subtract the ans if we did `flip` before.
                if(s1[i - n] != s[i - n]) --ans1;
                if(s2[i - n] != s[i - n]) --ans2;
            }
            if(i >= n - 1)
                ans = min({ans1, ans2, ans});
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
